## My Notes For Reviewer

-   I uploaded the .env file all you need to do change the config for ( database & mailtrap ).
-   After the pull make sure you migrate the database and seed the userSeeder class to login
-   I used image intervention package PLZ make sure that you have all its dependencies on your system
-   The storage symbolic link for storage/app/public is public/uploads
-   Internet connection required for the cdns.
-   I did create a multilingual functionality BUT i found that ADMINLTE version 3 do not support RTL i did my best to show how it will work in a real life project.
-   The users module is the administration there is only one super admin (admin@admin.com) who can (create,edit,delete) other admins.
-   recently i was using repository design pattern BUT as mentioned in the TASK DOCUMENT " It is important to
    follow Laravel practice and general designs concepts " so i worked on the default mvc structure most of logic set into the Models.
-   PLZ PLZ PLZ again don't mind the RTL Support it's a free template after all.
-   Don't foget to make composer update after the Pull.
